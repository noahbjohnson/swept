# swept
Hackrf sweep stream processing

## Overview

This project's goal is to create a high-performance rf mapper based off gpsd and the hackrf platform.
This repo is unstable.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

 - GCC (>4.1.1)
 - Python (>3.2)
 - scons
 - libusb
 - ncurses
 - gpsd/gpsd-clients

 These can all be installed and built on mac using `scripts/install_darwin.sh`. This is recommended since the homebrew dist of gpsd does not include the binaries we need.
 
### Install

- [Install golang](https://golang.org/doc/install)
